"DUST, DATA AND DISCOVERY: AQI ANALYSIS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE"

📊 Data Analysis Project using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn
This project is a comprehensive data analysis task performed using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical visualization to uncover insights from a real-world dataset.


🚀 Project Highlights

✅ Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for analysis

✅ Performed statistical summary and value counts

✅ Visualized distributions using histograms and boxplots

✅ Explored correlation and relationships using heatmaps and scatter plots

✅ Used Seaborn to generate appealing and insightful visualizations

✅ Demonstrated good use of NumPy for efficient numeric operations

✅ Implemented creativity in presenting the data and drawing conclusions


🧰 Libraries Used
NumPy – for numeric computations

Pandas – for data handling and preprocessing

Matplotlib – for plotting basic visualizations

Seaborn – for advanced and aesthetic statistical graphics
